In experiments we achieved the best performance using the option 'transform=adapt_costs(one)' to enforce unit costs.</p> <p>Preferred operators: Computing preferred operators is only enabled when setting pref=true because it has a nontrivial runtime cost. Using the heuristic for preferred operators without setting pref=true has no effect. Our implementation to compute preferred operators based on landmarks differs from the description in the literature (see reference above).The original implementation computes two kinds of preferred operators:</p> <ol> <li>If there is an applicable operator that reaches a landmark, all such operators are preferred.</li> <li>If no such operators exist, perform an FF-style relaxed exploration towards the nearest landmarks (according to the landmark orderings) and use the preferred operators of this exploration.</li> </ol> <p>Our implementation only considers preferred operators of the first type and does not include the second type. The rationale for this change is that it reduces code complexity and helps more cleanly separate landmark-based and FF-based computations in LAMA-like planner configurations. In our experiments, only considering preferred operators of the first type reduces performance when using the heuristic and its preferred operators in isolation but improves performance when using this heuristic in conjunction with the FF heuristic, as in LAMA-like planner configurations.</p> <p>Supported language features:</p> <ul> <li>action costs: supported</li> <li>conditional_effects: supported if the LandmarkFactory supports them; otherwise ignored</li> <li>axioms: ignored</li> </ul> <p>Properties:</p> <ul> <li>preferred operators: yes (if enabled; see <code>pref</code> option)</li> <li>admissible: no</li> <li>consistent: no</li> <li>safe: yes except on tasks with axioms or on tasks with conditional effects when using a LandmarkFactory not supporting them</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Evaluator/#landmark-cut_heuristic","title":"Landmark-cut heuristic","text":"<pre><code>lmcut(verbosity=normal, transform=no_transform(), cache_estimates=true)\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>verbosity ({silent, normal, verbose, debug}): Option to specify the verbosity level.<ul> <li><code>silent</code>: only the most basic output</li> <li><code>normal</code>: relevant information to monitor progress</li> <li><code>verbose</code>: full output</li> <li><code>debug</code>: like verbose with additional debug output</li> </ul> </li> <li>transform (AbstractTask): Optional task transformation for the heuristic.

Note, however, that for tasks that are not factored (in the sense of the JACM 2014 merge-and-shrink paper), the atomic transition systems on which merge-and-shrink heuristics are based are nondeterministic, which can lead to poor heuristics even when only perfect shrinking is performed.</p> <p>Note: When pruning unreachable states, admissibility and consistency is only guaranteed for reachable states and transitions between reachable states. While this does not impact regular A* search which will never encounter any unreachable state, it impacts techniques like symmetry-based pruning: a reachable state which is mapped to an unreachable symmetric state (which hence is pruned) would falsely be considered a dead-end and also be pruned, thus violating optimality of the search.</p> <p>Note: When using a time limit on the main loop of the merge-and-shrink algorithm, the heuristic will compute the maximum over all heuristics induced by the remaining factors if terminating the merge-and-shrink algorithm early. Exception: if there is an unsolvable factor, it will be used as the exclusive heuristic since the problem is unsolvable.</p> <p>Note: A currently recommended good configuration uses bisimulation based shrinking, the merge strategy SCC-DFP, and the appropriate label reduction setting (max_states has been altered to be between 10k and 200k in the literature).

This is done as described in the section \"pattern construction as search\" in the paper, except for the corrected search neighbourhood discussed below. For evaluating the neighbourhood, the \"counting approximation\" as introduced in the paper was implemented. An important difference however consists in the fact that this implementation computes all pattern databases for each candidate pattern rather than using A* search to compute the heuristic values only for the sample states for each pattern.</p> <p>Also the logic for sampling the search space differs a bit from the original implementation. The original implementation uses a random walk of a length which is binomially distributed with the mean at the estimated solution depth (estimation is done with the current pattern collection heuristic). In the Fast Downward implementation, also a random walk is used, where the length is the estimation of the number of solution steps, which is calculated by dividing the current heuristic estimate for the initial state by the average operator costs of the planning task (calculated only once and not updated during sampling!) to take non-unit cost problems into account. This yields a random walk of an expected lenght of np = 2 * estimated number of solution steps. If the random walk gets stuck, it is being restarted from the initial state, exactly as described in the original paper.</p> <p>The section \"avoiding redundant evaluations\" describes how the search neighbourhood of patterns can be restricted to variables that are relevant to the variables already included in the pattern by analyzing causal graphs. There is a mistake in the paper that leads to some relevant neighbouring patterns being ignored. See the errata for details. This mistake has been addressed in this implementation. The second approach described in the paper (statistical confidence interval) is not applicable to this implementation, as it doesn't use A* search but constructs the entire pattern databases for all candidate patterns anyway. The search is ended if there is no more improvement (or the improvement is smaller than the minimal improvement which can be set as an option), however there is no limit of iterations of the local search. This is similar to the techniques used in the original implementation as described in the paper.</p> <p>Supported language features:</p> <ul> <li>action costs: supported</li> <li>conditional effects: not supported</li> <li>axioms: not supported</li> </ul> <p>Properties:</p> <ul> <li>admissible: yes</li> <li>consistent: yes</li> <li>safe: yes</li> <li>preferred operators: no</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Evaluator/#pattern_database_heuristic","title":"Pattern database heuristic","text":"<p>TODO</p> <pre><code>pdb(pattern=greedy(), verbosity=normal, transform=no_transform(), cache_estimates=true)\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>pattern (PatternGenerator): pattern generation method</li> <li>verbosity ({silent, normal, verbose, debug}): Option to specify the verbosity level.<ul> <li><code>silent</code>: only the most basic output</li> <li><code>normal</code>: relevant information to monitor progress</li> <li><code>verbose</code>: full output</li> <li><code>debug</code>: like verbose with additional debug output</li> </ul> </li> <li>transform (AbstractTask): Optional task transformation for the heuristic.

The original implementation used an enforced hill-climbing (EHC) search with the PDB as the perfect heuristic, which ensured finding strongly optimal plans, i.e., optimal plans with a minimum number of zero-cost operators, in domains with zero-cost operators. The original implementation also slightly modified EHC to search for a best-improving successor, chosen uniformly at random among all best-improving successors.</p> <p>In contrast, the current implementation computes a plan alongside the computation of the PDB itself. A modification to Dijkstra's algorithm for computing the PDB values stores, for each state, the operator leading to that state (in a regression search). This generating operator is updated only if the algorithm found a cheaper path to the state. After Dijkstra finishes, the plan computation starts at the initial state and iteratively follows the generating operator, computes all operators of the same cost inducing the same transition, until reaching a goal. This constitutes a wildcard plan. It is turned into a regular one by randomly picking a single operator for each transition. </p> <p>Note that this kind of plan extraction does not consider all successors of a state uniformly at random but rather uses the previously deterministically chosen generating operator to settle on one successor state, which is biased by the number of operators leading to the same successor from the given state. Further note that in the presence of zero-cost operators, this procedure does not guarantee that the computed plan is strongly optimal because it does not minimize the number of used zero-cost operators leading to the state when choosing a generating operator. Experiments have shown (issue1007) that this speeds up the computation significantly while not having a strongly negative effect on heuristic quality due to potentially computing worse plans.</p> <p>Two further changes fix bugs of the original implementation to match the description in the paper. The first bug fix is to raise a flaw for all goal variables of the task if the plan for a PDB can be executed on the concrete task but does not lead to a goal state. Previously, such flaws would not have been raised because all goal variables are part of the collection from the start on and therefore not considered. This means that the original implementation accidentally disallowed merging patterns due to goal violation flaws. The second bug fix is to actually randomize the order of parallel operators in wildcard plan steps.</p>"},{"location":"PatternCollectionGenerator/#genetic_algorithm_patterns","title":"Genetic Algorithm Patterns","text":"<p>The following paper describes the automated creation of pattern databases with a genetic algorithm.

This is done as described in the section \"pattern construction as search\" in the paper, except for the corrected search neighbourhood discussed below. For evaluating the neighbourhood, the \"counting approximation\" as introduced in the paper was implemented. An important difference however consists in the fact that this implementation computes all pattern databases for each candidate pattern rather than using A* search to compute the heuristic values only for the sample states for each pattern.</p> <p>Also the logic for sampling the search space differs a bit from the original implementation. The original implementation uses a random walk of a length which is binomially distributed with the mean at the estimated solution depth (estimation is done with the current pattern collection heuristic). In the Fast Downward implementation, also a random walk is used, where the length is the estimation of the number of solution steps, which is calculated by dividing the current heuristic estimate for the initial state by the average operator costs of the planning task (calculated only once and not updated during sampling!) to take non-unit cost problems into account. This yields a random walk of an expected lenght of np = 2 * estimated number of solution steps. If the random walk gets stuck, it is being restarted from the initial state, exactly as described in the original paper.</p> <p>The section \"avoiding redundant evaluations\" describes how the search neighbourhood of patterns can be restricted to variables that are relevant to the variables already included in the pattern by analyzing causal graphs. There is a mistake in the paper that leads to some relevant neighbouring patterns being ignored. See the errata for details. This mistake has been addressed in this implementation. The second approach described in the paper (statistical confidence interval) is not applicable to this implementation, as it doesn't use A* search but constructs the entire pattern databases for all candidate patterns anyway. The search is ended if there is no more improvement (or the improvement is smaller than the minimal improvement which can be set as an option), however there is no limit of iterations of the local search.

The original implementation used an enforced hill-climbing (EHC) search with the PDB as the perfect heuristic, which ensured finding strongly optimal plans, i.e., optimal plans with a minimum number of zero-cost operators, in domains with zero-cost operators. The original implementation also slightly modified EHC to search for a best-improving successor, chosen uniformly at random among all best-improving successors.</p> <p>In contrast, the current implementation computes a plan alongside the computation of the PDB itself. A modification to Dijkstra's algorithm for computing the PDB values stores, for each state, the operator leading to that state (in a regression search). This generating operator is updated only if the algorithm found a cheaper path to the state. After Dijkstra finishes, the plan computation starts at the initial state and iteratively follows the generating operator, computes all operators of the same cost inducing the same transition, until reaching a goal. This constitutes a wildcard plan. It is turned into a regular one by randomly picking a single operator for each transition. </p> <p>Note that this kind of plan extraction does not consider all successors of a state uniformly at random but rather uses the previously deterministically chosen generating operator to settle on one successor state, which is biased by the number of operators leading to the same successor from the given state. Further note that in the presence of zero-cost operators, this procedure does not guarantee that the computed plan is strongly optimal because it does not minimize the number of used zero-cost operators leading to the state when choosing a generating operator.

This means that the original implementation accidentally disallowed merging patterns due to goal violation flaws.
