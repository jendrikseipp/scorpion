# Scorpion

Scorpion is a classical planning system that extends [Fast
Downward](https://www.fast-downward.org). The main extensions are:

* novel state-of-the-art algorithms for optimal classical planning
* additional search algorithms
* several new plugin options and utilities

See [below](#differences-between-scorpion-and-fast-downward) for a detailed list
of extensions. We regularly port the latest changes from Fast Downward to
Scorpion and also integrate some features from Scorpion back into Fast Downward.

## Instructions

Install the dependencies (the table below lists which versions are tested):

    sudo apt install cmake g++ git make python3

For plugins based on linear programming (e.g., `ocp()`, `pho()`) you need
to [add an LP solver](BUILD.md). Then compile the planner with

    ./build.py

and see the available options with

    ./fast-downward.py --help  # driver
    ./fast-downward.py --search -- --help  # search component

For more details (including build instructions for macOS and Windows), see the
documentation about [compiling](BUILD.md) and
[running](https://www.fast-downward.org/PlannerUsage) the planner. The [plugin
documentation](https://jendrikseipp.github.io/scorpion) shows which plugins are
available (heuristics, search algorithms, etc.) and how to use them.


### Recommended configuration

We recommend using the following configuration:

```
./fast-downward.py \
  --transform-task preprocess-h2 \
  ../benchmarks/gripper/prob01.pddl \
  --search "astar(scp_online([
        projections(sys_scp(max_time=100, max_time_per_restart=10)),
        cartesian()],
        saturator=perimstar, max_time=1000, interval=10K, orders=greedy_orders()),
        pruning=limited_pruning(pruning=atom_centric_stubborn_sets(), min_required_pruning_ratio=0.2))"
```

The `preprocess-h2` call prunes irrelevant operators in a preprocessing
step. The search configuration uses [partial order
reduction](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/SOCS/article/view/18535) and
maximizes over
[diverse](https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11673),
[subset-saturated](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/view/3503)
cost partitioning heuristics computed
[online](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/view/15976/) during
the search. The underlying abstractions are [Sys-SCP pattern
databases](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2019/780) and [Cartesian
abstractions](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11217).

(In [Downward Lab](https://lab.readthedocs.io/) you can use
`add_algorithm(name="scorpion", repo="path/to/repo", rev="scorpion",
component_options=[], driver_options=["--transform-task", "preprocess-h2",
"--alias", "scorpion"]` to run the recommended Scorpion configuration.)

#### Apptainer image

To simplify the installation process, we provide an executable
[Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/) container (formerly known as Singularity).
It accepts the same arguments as the `fast-downward.py` script (see above).

    # Download the image,
    apptainer pull scorpion.sif oras://ghcr.io/jendrikseipp/scorpion:latest

    # or build it yourself.
    apptainer build scorpion.sif Apptainer

    # Then run recommended configuration (available via "scorpion" alias).
    ./scorpion.sif --transform-task preprocess-h2 --alias scorpion PROBLEM_FILE

### IPC versions

If you prefer to run the Scorpion versions from the IPC 2018 or 2023 (which are
based on an older Fast Downward version and use different abstractions), we
recommend using the
[Scorpion 2018](https://bitbucket.org/ipc2018-classical/team44/src/ipc-2018-seq-opt/) or
[Scorpion 2023](https://github.com/ipc2023-classical/planner25) repos.


## Differences between Scorpion and Fast Downward

Diff between the latest merged version of Fast Downward and Scorpion:
https://github.com/jendrikseipp/scorpion/compare/main...scorpion

- Scorpion comes with the
  [h²-preprocessor](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/view/13708)
  by Vidal Alcázar and Álvaro Torralba that prunes irrelevant operators.
  Pass `--transform-task preprocess-h2` to use it.
- The `--transform-task` command allows you to run arbitrary preprocessing
  commands that transform the SAS+ output from the translator before
  passing it to the search.
- Scorpion uses [incremental search for Cartesian abstraction
  refinement](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/view/6667).
- Scorpion uses a
  [phmap::flat_hash_set](https://github.com/greg7mdp/parallel-hashmap) to check
  for duplicate states, which often drastically reduces the peak memory usage,
  compared to Fast Downward's `IntHashSet`.
- If [ccache](https://ccache.dev/) is installed (recommended), Scorpion
  uses it to cache compilation files.

### New translator options

- Use `--dump-predicates` and `--dump-static-atoms` to write files with
  information that's useful for learning domain control knowledge.


### New plugin options

- `{cegar/cartesian}(..., pick_flawed_abstract_state={batch_min_h, ...})`:
  find all current flaws, then iteratively repair the flaw that's closest to the goal
  ([paper](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/view/19819), default=`batch_min_h`).

- `{cegar/cartesian}(..., pick_split={max_cover, ...}, tiebreak_split={max_refined, ...})`:
  smarter strategies for splitting a flawed abstract state
  ([paper](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/view/19819), default=`max_cover`
  and `max_refined` for tiebreaking).

- `{cegar,cartesian}(..., dot_graph_verbosity={silent, write_to_console, write_to_file})`:
  write intermediate abstractions as Graphviz dot files to stdout or to files (default=`silent`).

- `hillclimbing(..., max_generated_patterns=200)`: limit the number of
  patterns generated by hill climbing.

- `systematic(..., pattern_type=interesting_general)`: compute interesting
  patterns for general cost partitioning.


### New cost partitioning algorithms for abstraction heuristics

We use Cartesian abstractions in the example configurations below
(`[cartesian()]`). You can also use pattern database heuristics, e.g.,
`[projections(systematic(2))]`, or mix abstractions, e.g.,
`[projections(systematic(3)), cartesian()]`. Some of the algorithms below
are also part of vanilla Fast Downward, but are only implemented for PDB
heuristics.

- Optimal cost partitioning:
  `ocp([cartesian()])`
- Canonical heuristic:
  `canonical_heuristic([cartesian()])`
- Uniform cost partitioning:
  `ucp([cartesian()], opportunistic=false)`
- Opportunistic uniform cost partitioning:
  `ucp([cartesian()], ..., opportunistic=true)`
- Greedy zero-one cost partitioning:
  `gzocp([cartesian()], ...)`
- Saturated cost partitioning:
  `scp([cartesian()], ...)` (offline), `scp_online([cartesian()], ...)` (online)
- (Saturated) post-hoc optimization:
  `pho([cartesian()], ..., saturated={false,true})` (offline),
  `operatorcounting([pho_abstraction_constraints([cartesian()], saturated={false,true})])` (online)

You can also compute the maximum over abstraction heuristics:

- `maximize([cartesian()])`

The plugin documentation shows all options for [cost partitioning
heuristics](https://jendrikseipp.github.io/scorpion/Evaluator/#cost_partitioning_heuristics).

## New pattern collection generators

- Systematic patterns with size limits:
  `sys_scp(max_pattern_size=X, max_pdb_size=Y, max_collection_size=Z, ..., saturate=false)`
- Sys-SCP patterns:
  `sys_scp(...)`


### New cost partitioning algorithms for landmark heuristics

Example using A* search and saturated cost partitioning over BJOLP
landmarks:

    --evaluator
      "lmc=landmark_cost_partitioning(lm_merged([lm_rhw(), lm_hm(m=1)]),
      cost_partitioning=suboptimal, greedy=true,
      reuse_costs=true, scoring_function=max_heuristic_per_stolen_costs)"
    --search
      "astar(lmc, lazy_evaluator=lmc)"

Different cost partitioning algorithms for landmark heuristics:

- Optimal cost partitioning (part of vanilla Fast Downward):
  `landmark_cost_partitioning(..., cost_partitioning=optimal)`
- Canonical heuristic:
  `landmark_cost_partitioning(..., cost_partitioning=canonical)`
- Post-hoc optimization:
  `landmark_cost_partitioning(..., cost_partitioning=pho)`
- Uniform cost partitioning:
  `landmark_cost_partitioning(..., cost_partitioning=suboptimal, greedy=false, reuse_costs=false)`
- Opportunistic uniform cost partitioning (part of vanilla Fast Downward):
  `landmark_cost_partitioning(..., cost_partitioning=suboptimal, greedy=false, reuse_costs=true, scoring_function=min_stolen_costs)`
- Greedy zero-one cost partitioning:
  `landmark_cost_partitioning(..., cost_partitioning=suboptimal, greedy=true, reuse_costs=false, scoring_function=max_heuristic)`
- Saturated cost partitioning:
  `landmark_cost_partitioning(..., cost_partitioning=suboptimal, greedy=true, reuse_costs=true, scoring_function=max_heuristic_per_stolen_costs)`


## New search engines

- Breadth-first search (without overhead of the more general `eager()` search):
  `brfs()`
- Depth-first search:
  `dfs()`
- Exhaustive search (useful for dumping the reachable state space of small input tasks):
  `dump_reachable_search_space()`
- IDA* search:
  `idastar(cegar(cache_estimates=false))`
- Iterative width search:
  `iw(width=2)`

## Scientific experiments

We recommend to use the [latest release](https://github.com/aibasel/downward/releases/latest) instead of the tip of the main branch.
The [Downward Lab](https://lab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) Python package helps running Fast Downward experiments.
Our separate [benchmark repository](https://github.com/aibasel/downward-benchmarks) contains a collection of planning tasks.

## Supported software versions

The planner is mainly developed under Linux; and all of its features should work with no restrictions under this platform.
The planner should compile and run correctly on macOS, but we cannot guarantee that it works as well as under Linux.
The same comment applies for Windows, where additionally some diagnostic features (e.g., reporting peak memory usage when the planner is terminated by a signal) are not supported.
Setting time and memory limits and running portfolios is not supported under Windows either.

This version of Fast Downward has been tested with the following software versions:

| OS           | Python | C++ compiler                                                     | CMake |
| ------------ | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Ubuntu 22.04 | 3.10   | GCC 11, GCC 12, Clang 14                                         | 3.22  |
| Ubuntu 20.04 | 3.8    | GCC 10, Clang 12                                                 | 3.16  |
| macOS 12     | 3.10   | AppleClang 14                                                    | 3.24  |
| macOS 11     | 3.8    | AppleClang 13                                                    | 3.24  |
| Windows 10   | 3.8    | Visual Studio Enterprise 2019 (MSVC 19.29) and 2022 (MSVC 19.31) | 3.22  |

We test LP support with CPLEX 22.1.1 and SoPlex 6.0.3+. On Ubuntu we
test both CPLEX and SoPlex. On Windows we currently only test CPLEX,
and on macOS we do not test LP solvers (yet).

## History

The current version of Fast Downward is the merger of three different
projects:

- the original version of Fast Downward developed by Malte Helmert
  and Silvia Richter
- LAMA, developed by Silvia Richter and Matthias Westphal based on
  the original Fast Downward
- FD-Tech, a modified version of Fast Downward developed by Erez
  Karpas and Michael Katz based on the original code
