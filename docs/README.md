# Scorpion Documentation

This website contains the documentation for the Scorpion planner. Since Scorpion is based on [Fast Downward](https://fast-downward.org/), the documentation is mostly the same as the Fast Downward documentation.

  -  The [README](readme.md) shows how to run Scorpion and lists the differences to Fast Downward.
  -  [Search plugins](search/index.md) documents the different ingredients for the
     search configuration, such as [search algorithms](search/SearchAlgorithm.md) and [heuristics](search/Evaluator.md).
  -  [Syntax for search plugins](search-plugin-syntax.md) defines the syntax for configuring the search
     plugins.
  -  [Exit Codes](exit-codes.md) describes the exit codes as returned by the
     planner.
  -  [PDDL support](pddl-support.md) specifies the subset of PDDL that is
     supported by the planner.
  -  [Translator output format](translator-output-format.md) documents the
     internal file format that is generated by the translator component and
     used as input by the search component.
